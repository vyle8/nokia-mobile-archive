      <p>Nokia Mobile Archive is a digital archive exploring the devices that defined mobile culture from the early 2000s to the smartphone era.These phones were not just tools for communication, they were objects people carried, customized, played with, and built everyday habits around.

      </p>

      <p>
       This project focuses on a selection of iconic Nokia models to examine how design, interface, and media shaped early mobile experiences. Through phone hardware, menu systems, advertising, and games like Snake, the archive looks at how technology became personal, social, and cultural.
