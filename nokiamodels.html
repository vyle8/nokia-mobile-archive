        <h2>3310</h2>
        <p>The first model in my archive is the Nokia 3310, released in 2000. It represents communication as a tool which is practical, durable, and focused on calls and texts. 
Its thick plastic body, small screen, and physical buttons make interaction fully tactile. 
Culturally, the 3310 became iconic for its reliability and long battery life.
Today, it symbolizes a time when phones were simple tools, not digital platforms.

        <h2>6600</h2>
        <p>The second model is the Nokia 6600, released in 2003. It represents the phone as a platform not just a tool, but a small computer.
It ran Symbian OS, which allowed apps, a camera, and deeper menus. The rounded body and larger screen made it feel more like a digital device than a simple phone.
Interaction was still button-based, but now users navigated software systems instead of just features.The 6600 marks the moment when phones started becoming programmable and personal not just functional.

        <h2>8800</h2>
        <p>The third model is the Nokia 8800, released in 2005. It represents the phone as a luxury object, something designed for status and style, not just function.
Unlike plastic phones, the 8800 used stainless steel and a slim sliding form. It felt heavy, polished, and expensive in the hand.
The interface stayed simple, but the materials changed the meaning of the device.
Culturally, the 8800 shows how phones became fashion and identity, not just tools for communication.

        <h2>N95</h2>
        <p>The fourth model is the Nokia N95, released in 2007. It represents the phone as a multimedia device not just for calling and texting, but for music, photos, video, and internet.
Its dual-slide design revealed different controls for media and numbers, turning the phone into a machine with modes.
With a 5-megapixel camera, GPS, and Wi-Fi, it blurred the line between phone and computer.
Culturally, the N95 marks Nokia’s peak the moment right before touchscreens changed everything.
